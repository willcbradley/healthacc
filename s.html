        <u>What is science?</u>
        <br><br>
        We're surrounded by matter.
        <br><br>
        It behaves in mysterious ways, governed by laws we don't fully understand.
        <br><br>
        But our understanding is improving. And in the process, we're learning to do things our ancestors could only have dreamed of.
        <br><br>
        To do this, we create fallible explanatory theories, test them against physical reality, and iterate based on feedback.
        <br><br>
        We call this process science. And as far as we know, science has no upper bound.
        <br><br>
        There's no physical law that prevents us from solving whatever material problems are on the horizon.
        <br><br>
        But where to start?
