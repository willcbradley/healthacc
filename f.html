        <u>What moves science forward?</u>
        <br><br>
        The basic algorithm is simple.
        <br><br>
        We make a theory, test the theory, keep what works, and discard the rest.
        <br><br>
        But in practice, things are more complex.
        <br><br>
        Real-world 'science' is muddled by resource constraints, short-term sentiment, and status games.
        <br><br>
        How to navigate this?
        <br><br>
        By securing upside, and removing downside.
        <br><br>
        Overcoming resource constraints, without losing sight of the overall trajectory. Listening to sentiment, without losing sight of the long-term trajectory. Surviving the status game, without depending on it.
        <br><br>
        We walk a fine line. On one side, impracticality, and on the other, short-sightedness.
        <br><br>
        Unless we strike a balance, there will be no future.
