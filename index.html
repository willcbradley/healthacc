        The world is speeding up.
        <br><br>
        Technology creates leverage, which creates uncertainty, which threatens our medical institutions. This thesis is an attempt to define this problem (so we can solve it while we have the chance).
        <br><br>
        Consider two opposing forces: tradition and progress.
        <br><br>
        If healthcare moves too slowly, it will devolve into negative-sum rent-seeking. But if we let new inventions run wild, the mistakes could be unacceptable.
        <br><br>
        In the most likely case, we end up with doctors trying to justify useless rules, and technologists trying to discard vital ones.
        <br><br>
        How to prepare for this?
        <br><br>
        By combining the best of both worlds.
        <br><br>
        The faster the frontier moves, the greater the distance between labs and wards. To prevent collapse, we need people who can speak (and teach) both languages.
        <br><br>
        In practice, producing these people is difficult.
        <br><br>
        Current incentives push us toward single, narrow status games. Only by truly learning both skill sets, as individuals, can we carve a path for future generations.
        <br><br>
        This is no small task. It'll take decades to pan out (if at all).
        <br><br>
        But health is priceless. Our bodies stubbornly work to keep us alive against all odds. Without fighting entropy, we have nothing.
        <br><br>
        If you see what I see, let me know.
