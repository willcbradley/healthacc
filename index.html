    <b>health/acc</b>
    <br><br>
    The world is changing. Fast.
    <br><br>
    Technology creates leverage, which creates uncertainty, which threatens our medical institutions. health/acc is an attempt to define this problem (so we can solve it while we have the chance).
    <br><br>
    Consider two opposing forces: tradition and progress.
    <br><br>
    If incumbents move too slowly, today's healthcare will devolve into negative-sum rent-seeking. But if we let new inventions run wild, the mistakes could be fatal.
    <br><br>
    In the most likely case, we end up with doctors trying to justify useless rules, and technologists trying to discard vital ones.
    <br><br>
    How to prepare for this?
    <br><br>
    By combining the best of both worlds.
    <br><br>
    The faster the frontier moves, the greater the distance between labs and wards. To prevent collapse, we need people who can speak both languages.
    <br><br>
    In practice, producing these people is difficult.
    <br><br>
    Current incentives push us toward single, narrow status games. Only by truly learning both skill sets, as individuals, can we carve a path for future generations.
    <br><br>
    This is no small task. It'll take decades to pan out (if at all).
    <br><br>
    But health is priceless. Our bodies stubbornly work to keep us alive against all odds. Without this, we have nothing.
    <br><br>
    If you see what I see (and can prove it), let me know.
