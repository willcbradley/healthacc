        <u>What moves art forward?</u>
        <br><br>
        Nothing lasts forever.
        <br><br>
        We live in constant flux. The present is always changing, and as a result, so are the demands of the future.
        <br><br>
        To fulfil these demands, we need to align our short-, medium-, and long-term interests in a single direction. And to do this, we need a non-contradictory story that justifies the effort.
        <br><br>
        Art moves forward when we test such stories against the world, and adapt them accordingly.
        <br><br>
        Like science, art is vulnerable to corruption by short-term incentive structures.
        <br><br>
        But corruption is weak. Nobody, no matter how fast, can outrun reality.
