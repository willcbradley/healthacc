        <u>What is art?</u>
        <br><br>
        The world is more than just matter.
        <br><br>
        Science can tell us how to do things, but only art can tell us why.
        <br><br>
        At its core, art tries to create material representations of immaterial concepts.
        <br><br>
        Experiences that can be felt, but not described. Lessons that can be learned, but not taught. Ideas that can be heard, but not spoken.
        <br><br>
        In this way, art shapes the underlying value structures through which we perceive everything else.
        <br><br>
        But which direction to shape them?
