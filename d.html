        <u>What Is A Doctor?</u>
        <br><br>
        Jobs can change quickly.
        <br><br>
        Not long ago, calculators were people, and street lights were lit by hand.
        <br><br>
        But some things never change. And now that we've defined medicine, we can figure out the core of what it means to be a doctor.
        <br><br>
        To reiterate, medicine can be thought of as:
        <br><br>
        1) Combating entropy, biologically speaking
        <br>
        2) Relieving suffering, morally speaking
        <br><br>
        Let's start with the first of these. How do doctors help the body fight stressors?
        <br><br>
        Any skill has two precursors: knowing <i>what</i> to do, and knowing <i>how</i> to do it.
        <br><br>
        In medicine, "what" changes quickly. The frontier moves too fast to be memorised. So a lot of knowing what to do is being able to digest new information on the fly.
        <br><br>
        This, plus a solid foundation of scientific and clinical principles, let us understand a clinical scenario, weigh up our options, and decide on a course of action.
        <br><br>
        (Of course, memorisation is useful for freeing up working memory, and our understanding of biology is too imperfect to rely solely on principles, but the general point stands.)
        <br><br>
        Now assume we know what to do. How to do it?
        <br><br>
        Either we do it ourselves (which requires repetition and feedback), or we work with others who do it (which requires clear and effective communication). Regardless of context, this gives us the best possible odds of getting things done.
        <br><br>
        That covers fighting entropy. But what about relieving suffering?
        <br><br>
        This seems less clear-cut.
        <br><br>
        We're not talking about physical pain (this falls under the previous section) but "suffering" in a moral sense.
        <br><br>
        Broadly speaking, we could define this kind of suffering as a lack of meaningful correlation between the pain of today and the improvement of tomorrow.
        <br><br>
        Insofar as individual doctors can remedy this, it probably comes down to a mix of empathy, rapport-building, and open-ended discussion.
        <br><br>
        What's the end result of all this?
        <br><br>
        If done correctly, we help the body function as best as possible, and give meaning to whatever problems remain.
        <br><br>
        We improve the experience of the present, and the perception of the future.
        <br><br>
        Jobs will change. Technology will advance. But these core aims will always, always be relevant.
