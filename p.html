        <u>What's The Price Of Becoming A Doctor?</u>
        <br><br>
        Hard work is hard.
        <br><br>
        Many projects come with on-call, or night shift, or constant stress. Although these costs are real, they'll change with time and circumstances.
        <br><br>
        But now that we've defined medicine, and defined the inputs required to become a doctor, we should be able to map out the inherent (i.e. unchanging) downsides that come with the territory. Let's see what we can come up with.
        <br><br>
        Healthcare requires trust.
        <br><br>
        Insofar as doctors aren't obsolete, it's because patients rely on them during vulnerable times.
        <br><br>
        But trust scales poorly.
        <br><br>
        At a certain point, social ties become weak enough that shame can't be used to enforce the rules. So, in place of trust, we create laws and regulations.
        <br><br>
        In one sense, this is crucial. Laws provide structure, and help us move forward. But on the other hand, these rules are disconnected from reality — they're backed by power, rather than nature or markets.
        <br><br>
        The further a game is disconnected from reality, the more arbitrary the rules can become. Inevitably, things devolve into a status contest — impractical at best, corrupt and demoralising at worst.
        <br><br>
        And so, the inevitable price of becoming a doctor is playing this game. Enduring the lack of meritocracy. Putting up with arbitrary requirements. All while incurring massive opportunity cost in the process.
        <br><br>
        Luckily, this price is paid voluntarily.
        <br><br>
        If the transaction no longer makes sense, we can opt out. If we've built the right foundations, our fundamental skills can be transferred anywhere else.
        <br><br>
        Time's ticking. The world is moving too quickly for us to be blindly chasing status.
        <br><br>
        If there is any path forward, it'll be found by those who are playing the game with eyes wide open.
