         <u>What is medicine not?</u>
        <br><br>
        Some things never change.
        <br><br>
        At any given moment, humanity has unlimited problems, and limited capacity to solve them. Medicine is no exception.
        <br><br>
        Because of this, healthcare is plagued by eternal questions. Do we treat more people today, or invest in prevention for tomorrow? Is one life more valuable than another? What's the role of individual responsibility?
        <br><br>
        This is complicated by markets (or lack thereof).
        <br><br>
        Public systems increase accessibility at the cost of efficiency, and private companies increase efficiency at the cost of accessibility.
        <br><br>
        Why mention these problems?
        <br><br>
        Because they're inherent to the tension between medicine (the art) and medicine (the science).
        <br><br>
        Unsolvable dilemmas are baked into the process. For better or worse, we're forced to shoulder this impossible burden.
        <br><br>
        But how could it be any other way?
