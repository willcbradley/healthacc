        <u>What inputs create a doctor?</u>
        <br><br>
        Mastery takes practice.
        <br><br>
        We've just defined the skills that make a doctor. But how are these skills learned?
        <br><br>
        Fundamentally it boils down to feedback loops. Let's go through each of the domains we discussed, and get more specific.
        <br><br>
        *   *   *
        <br><br>
        # Core scientific and clinical principles
        <br><br>
        By "scientific" principles, we mean the core, foundational ideas that underpin our current understanding of the universe. They help us understand (and build) new technology, and give structure to the rest of our medical knowledge.
        <br><br>
        These principles are learned by building things from scratch, and testing them against nature. Think: writing code, planting a tree, launching a rocket etc.
        <br><br>
        "Clinical" principles are rooted in science, but go beyond that. They're often learned on the job, and have inbuilt heuristics for managing uncertainty.
        <br><br>
        Time is finite. We can't reason everything out from scratch. Clinical principles are ideas that thrive under these constraints — they teach us to apply our perfect theories in an imperfect world.
        <br><br><br>
        # Integrating new ideas efficiently
        <br><br>
        A big part of learning quickly comes from having a solid foundation of principles. The stronger our framework of knowledge, the easier it is to hang stuff on.
        <br><br>
        Beyond that, repeated exposure to fast-moving problems helps us pattern-match new data quickly. This can only really be learned through experience.
        <br><br><br>
        # Memorisation (to free up working memory) 
        <br><br>
        As of writing, this problem seems ~solved: active recall and spaced repetition.
        <br><br><br>
        # Clinical Skills:
        <br><br>
        This requries (1) experience, and (2) good feedback.
        <br><br>
        Currently, this mostly learned in real-world clinical situations. Maybe one day, lifelike simulations will become cheap enough that this is no longer the case.
        <br><br><br>
        # Communication
        <br><br>
        If scientific principles arise from nature, communication principles arise from human nature.
        <br><br>
        These are learned through unambiguous feedback from people who are incentivised to act truthfully. Negotiations, pitches, and poker are all great examples.
        <br><br>
        *   *    *      
        <br><br>
        Over time, details will shift.
        <br><br>
        The relative importance of these skills may differ, and the context in which they're learned will definitely change.
        <br><br>
        But if we're grounded in these domains, we're always in a good position to adapt.
        <br><br>
        And in a world as uncertain as ours, that's about as much as we can hope for.
