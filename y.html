        <u>Why advance medicine?</u>
        <br><br>
        The sun is going to die.
        <br><br>
        Eventually, it will fizzle out, leaving earth uninhabitable.
        <br><br>  
        But there are other planets. Other galaxies, with other suns. What's to stop us from exploring them?
        <br><br>
        No matter how much our medical knowledge grows, it will have limits. No matter how compelling our stories sound, they can never be self-reinforcing.
        <br><br>
        We cannot afford to be passive - an irreducible element of strength is required to move forward.
        <br><br>
        Sure, the world is complex. Humanity faces no shortage of problems, and these problems are extremely tough.
        <br><br>
        But we are tougher.
        <br><br>
        The next generation of doctors will be confronted with unforseen challenges, just like those who came before. We owe it to future generations to overcome these challenges, in spite of everything.
        <br><br>
        Beneath the science and art of medicine, there's an unshakeable assumption. An insistence that human life is intrinsically valuable, no matter what.
        <br><br>
        Every lecture, every research paper, and every treatment decision aims to reinforce this premise, even if unknowingly.
        <br><br>
        Look around. The world is full of suffering. How can we stand by, and not try to make things better? Not by arrogantly tearing everything down, but by building iteratively on the best insights of the past?
        <br><br>
        We're all-in. Might as well act like it.
