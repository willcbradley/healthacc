        <u>What Could Medicine Become?</u>
        <br><br>
        Tech is improving. Fast.
        <br><br>
        If history continues, we're going to get rapidly better at fighting biological stressors.
        <br><br>
        But as the science of medicine accelerates, the art will lag behind. 
        <br><br>
        Incumbents will cling to traditions, as they've always done. But in some cases, their caution will be warranted.
        <br><br>
        The stakes have never been higher. If we get this wrong, billions will die. That's the whole point of the health/acc thesis.
        <br><br>
        But assume we're successful. Assume we survive. What then?
        <br><br>
        What are we working towards? What can we look forward to? What might we imagine, when we think of what's to come?
        <br><br>
        Imagine a world where cancer is nothing more than a nuisance. A world where your surgeon is built in a factory, and trained in a data center as it orbits Earth.
        <br><br>
        Imagine a future where the average 80-year-old has never known of dementia. Where they spend more time chasing their grandchildren, and less time chasing up medical referrals.
        <br><br>
        Imagine mapping the microbiome. Or giving genome-specific antibiotics. Or doubling global life expectancy.
        <br><br>
        No doubt these are naive predictions. No doubt there will be unforseen challenges. But they're solvable. 
        <br><br>
        The only way out is through. We will build an incredible future, or die trying.
